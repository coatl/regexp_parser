	* Made ruby 1.8.6 the base for all 1.8 syntax, and the 1.8 name a pointer
		to the latest (1.8.7 at this time)

	* Removed look-behind assertions (positive and negative) from 1.8 syntax

	* Added control (\cc and \C-c) and meta (\M-c) escapes to 1.8 syntax

	* The default syntax is now the one of the running ruby version in both the
    lexer and the parser.
